# Traceability

Every screen traces back to a feature and forward to the issue that built it.

This table is the single source of truth for Milestone 1 section 6 and for the
Milestone 4 report. Keep it current - a PR that adds a route and does not
update this file should not be approved.

## Business rules

Numbered, so issues and tests can cite them.

| # | Rule | Enforced where | Tested by |
|---|------|----------------|-----------|
| BR1 | Only available products can be displayed in the product catalog. | Product catalog | TBD |
| BR2 | Buyers may add or update cart items only when the requested quantity is a positive integer and does not exceed current available stock. Adding an item to the cart does not reserve stock. | Cart | TBD |
| BR3 | A buyer must be authenticated before placing an order. | Checkout | TBD |
| BR4 | A buyer can view only their own orders. | Orders | TBD |
| BR5 | Sellers may create and manage only products belonging to their own store. Product ownership must be derived from the authenticated seller identity. | Seller product management | TBD |
| BR6 | Sellers can view and manage incoming orders related to their products. | Seller order management | TBD |
| BR7 | Seller analytics must be calculated from completed or valid order data. | Seller analytics | TBD |
| BR8 | Before creating an order, the system must revalidate product availability and stock using the latest stock data. If stock is insufficient, the order must not be created and the buyer must be informed which item caused the problem. | Checkout/order creation | TBD |
| BR9 | Product updates (price, stock quantity, and product information) must validate that price is strictly positive (> 0) and stock quantity is a non-negative integer (>= 0). If an update fails validation, the database transaction is aborted, and all previous valid data remains unchanged. | Seller product management | TBD |
